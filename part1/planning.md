# General Notes

Broad headers/concepts/ways to organize:

- Disclaimers/Expectations:
	- Why Python/PyTorch? It's standard. Plus I find pytorch keeps the theory and implementation pleasantly close.


- Training Loop: How to Fit the Model to the Data
	- Forward Pass (Prediction)
	- Loss Calculation
	- Backprop
	- Parameter update

- Modules and Composability: How to Build More Flexible Models
	- Modules are blueprints
	- Training modules with batches, optimizers and dataloaders
