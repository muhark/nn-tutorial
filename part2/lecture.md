# Motivation

## Who is this for?

- Many social scientists use quantitative approaches to study complex questions.
- Familiarity with statistics, maybe also machine learning.
- But **deep learning** seems daunting.
- Aim is not to simplify subject, but to translate existing knowledge and expertise.

:::notes
- In short, me from a few years ago.
- Received training in quantitative methods, causal inference, some machine learning
- But deep learning always treated as a separate super-complicated thing
- Lots of resources for learning deep learning out there, but focus tends to be for (I assume) a CS audience.
- As quantitative social scientists, we're not seeking to avoid the math--on the contrary, we want to understand the tools and the resulting models. More on this in a bit.

## What is Deep Learning?

- Approach to using computers to learn patterns in data
- based around a modular set of tools loosely inspired by biological neurons.
<!--- Basis of many advanced systems seen today.-->

::: notes
- "Machine learning" (it is in fact arguably a subfield)
